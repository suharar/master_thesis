# Study 3

## Introduction
Study 3 extends Study 2a by investigating GPT-4o's ability to create tailored advertising content based on a blended model of the OCEAN, excluding Neuroticism, consistent with our previous scope. In this study, we compare participants' perceptions of ads tailored to one of their personality traits with those tailored to a blended personality profile, which in this context refers to the mixed scores of BFI-2S for four target traits. Aligning with H5, we focus on the potential effects to perceived personalization. A comprehensive copy of the survey is available in `study3/survey_materials/study3_survey_questions.pdf`.
