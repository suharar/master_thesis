After his last picture interpretation I would say xNTP currently.  However,...|||I'm a big fan of trying to find the dominant and inferior functions first and foremost. However, I don't think Immerse is using dominant Te at all. Though, we'll have to wait and see as the process...|||Some of these questions made me smile. I love the gut feeling, movie picture thing. I'm thinking {MBTI type} right now. This could obviously change at some point. I'm seeing Ni-Se in your interpretation...|||Exactly. Many people have even kept Personality Unknown under their name whilst enjoying the forum and slowly putting the pieces of their type together at the same time. Some people type as...|||I didn't call your way of helping rude. I called the way you went about it rude. Let's not get that mixed up.  In any case, this conversation is completely derailing the purpose of the thread....|||Your help isn't unwanted sparkles (laughs). However, the part that I have bolded in your last paragraph is where I don't agree. You explained Fi really well in your last sentence. However,...|||Talent among theory has nothing to do with how you process information.  I agree that those questions do not have enough specified to rule out one type or another. However, you have no idea where...|||This is all stereotypical.  Sensors are completely capable of being interested in theory. We have already established this in many threads throughout PersonalityCafe. Yes, the OP's title is {MBTI type}...|||{html link} I am very glad to see that you are being open minded throughout this process. I have a million possibilities swirling around in my brain right now but rather than unload them all on you, I...|||I can't speak for everyone else here, but for me, I'm just looking for your function order. I'm going to link you to a post by one of the members here, it sheds some light on E vs. I. Click here:...|||Where I have bolded-- this is where I'm seeing inferior Te. Where I have underlined is a common thing with Fi dominant users. Tone of voice is a very sensitive thing for them generally. I think...|||I'm definitely starting to think that you use inferior Te. If this is true, then that would mean you are an introvert. I'm really thinking that {MBTI type} is a definite possibility right now. I am still...|||Taylor is not objective in the terms of sensory data. Everything sensory is personalized, subjective, what it means to her. She doesn't take data for what it is like an Se user would. All of her...|||The competitive, buisinesswomen persona is also indicative of an enneagram Type Three.|||{html link} type can be deemed weird in school. This is becoming highly stereotypical. This is why so many people mistype.

I think xSFP is far more likely than xNFP in my opinion. It's not the best idea to rely on tests for typing. I have...|||Congratulations emerald sea! You're now (slightly) emerald and very sparkly. I thoroughly enjoy your posts and I hope to see many more. :)|||Taylor Swift as an {MBTI type} is the single most hilarious thing I've read today. She is not near Mila Kunis or Carmen Electra territory. There is no Se in Taylor Swift and there is no Ni.  The w4 has...|||velvetoveralls Taylor Swift is not cool (and not the high school sense of the word) enough to be a 3w4. If she is a 3, it's 3w2 territory. In any case, do you know Taylor Swift personally? Are you...|||{html link} could be an Ne-Te loop then. Fi is very hard to see anyway as it is an introverted function. :)|||I don't know if you're aware of the rules on PersonalityCafe but I have asked you twice now to stop and this is the third and last time I am asking you to respectfully follow the rules and to respect...|||I didn't make anything personal. I told you I was not going to engage any further in this conversation with you. This is off-topic. Your comment was very rude and do not quote me again.|||{html link} is what really bugs me-- when others compare themselves or people they know to a character or person to try to prove that they are indeed that type. This is behavior not cognitive processes....|||Have you studied Jungian Cognitive Functions? You type people based on how they process information.      I think Snooki does use Ne. She does not see things as they are. She sees things as...|||You're typing behaviour. Behaviour does not equal cognitive functions/information processing. Who people are attracted to/are in a relationship with does not equal this either. Deena does not use...|||Adding to the possibility bin: This girl could be an {MBTI type}. Same auxiliary and tertiary function as the {MBTI type}. Different dominant and inferior function than the {MBTI type}.|||Plot twist: The dogs let themselves out. :shocked:|||{html link}  Thank you kaleidoscope!

Not other people saying, You have these traits, here's your type. Like I once again...|||pclaradactyl Most of that information is flawed. Ni is the creation of mental imagery independent of outer stimuli.  Ni generates abstract structural images of a given problem domain that a person...|||Ne and Se cannot be present within the same person. It's impossible. You cannot use both.
