I find it to represent my inner self. Thank you.   I might make it my new avatar.   -Posh Eagle|||Fellow bird, wonderful to see you again. I am glad you admit this. Thankfully we both get to enjoy the reign of our new leader.     This does not represent me.  -Posh Eagle|||Dear {MBTI type},   I genuinely hope you are as well and feisty as ever.

Would you be so kind and give me concrete evidence for his obnoxiousness? I truly am curious. You may find his behavior as such,...|||I would like to know how you were planning to measure Mr. Trump's objective level of obnoxiousness. I must say that I find him rather charming.   -Posh Eagle|||There are days when I feel mighty and dangerous, yet I would not consider myself a threat to this nation. Thus I am confident that Mr. Trump is not the worst of all options.   -Posh Eagle|||It seems to me that you are the one lacking common sense.   May the best man win.   -Posh Eagle|||If I was you, I would not trust {MBTI type}. They have ruined several of my threads. I was not pleased. However, you may be grateful for my two cents: do what your heart tells you to do.   Looking back,...|||My peers have also stated that my formality is a guilty pleasure. I strongly disagree. It seems rather obvious to me that it is the other way around, despite the fact that very few people seem to...|||I understand your point.

However, I must point out that since I am eighteen years old I am definitely an adult.   -Posh Eagle|||I can only assume that I am the former one. However, do not underestimate yourself, fellow bird. I am sure the likes of you have their place in the world.   -Posh Eagle|||Fellow bird, I see that you resemble a parrot as much as I am similar to an eagle.   -Posh Eagle|||It seems to me that being an {MBTI type} is ultimately worth it.   -Posh Eagle|||Overrated: Anything that is given too much credit and hype.  This is from Urban Dictionary. The credit or hype revolving around being an SJ comes from the society. I dare you to be proud and...|||If you say so. I must say that being an SJ is overrated.     I would not be so sure. Have you?   -Posh Eagle|||I am always prepared. You should consider becoming an {MBTI type}.

I merely skimmed through the thread and it was not evident enough.   -Posh Eagle|||I am glad we can discuss bird to bird. I must say that my extended absence was very unfortunate and hopefully will not happen again.     How can I be of assistance?   -Posh Eagle|||I see that you are trying to troll me. However, I am not threatened by your actions. I am a strong and independent peer.   -Posh Eagle|||I believe the word you are looking for is combined, not intertwined, my peer. You might benefit from checking that the lyrics are correct before quoting them.   -Posh Eagle|||Do not make such a move on me. There will be consequences.   {html link}    Thank you for your kind...|||I am glad that my attention is this important to you. Fellow bird, it truly makes me feel special.     You might want to reconsider your statement. Parrot greatly reminds me of an {MBTI type}, whereas I...|||Fellow bird, I appreciate the fact that you are this devoted to me. I want to assure that having multiple peers myself does not make you an any less valuable one.   -Posh Eagle|||You might want to reconsider your trust on conspiracy theories.   However, thank you for your deep respect for me. I am delighted to know that peers like you exist.  -Posh Eagle|||I am glad that there is a real NT who shares my interest in Mr. Trump. I truly hope the best man wins the election.   In addition, the fascination you express for eagles is inspiring.   -Posh...|||Thank you, peer.

In addition, I would like to point out that you should have said your level of commitment instead of...|||What can I say, I have faith in everyone regardless of whether they deserve it. I truly hope that this time I will not have to regret my decision to trust {MBTI type}.   -Posh Eagle|||Based on my previous experience, I did not think that the day would come when I turn to {MBTI type} for advice again. However, here we are.   I have noticed that many of my {MBTI type} peers are eccentric yet...|||Greetings, fellow {MBTI type} and others using this forum.
